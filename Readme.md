# AI-Powered C++ Code Analyzer

## 1. Project Structure

### 1.1 Main Application
- Orchestrates the flow between different components
- Handles user input and output

### 1.2 Source File Parser
- Utilizes LLVM to parse C++17 source files
- Extracts Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- Generates intermediate representation for AI processing

### 1.3 AI Model Interface
- Implements CodeBERT for code understanding
- Integrates Microsoft Phi-3 for natural language processing
- Uses PyTorch as the deep learning framework

### 1.4 NLP Query Processor
- Parses and understands user queries
- Maps queries to relevant code sections
- Generates responses based on AI analysis

### 1.5 User Interface
- Provides a command-line interface or simple GUI
- Allows users to input C++ source files and ask questions

## 2. Core Functionality

### 2.1 Source File Parsing
- Load C++17 source file
- Use LLVM to parse the file and generate AST
- Convert AST to a format suitable for AI processing

### 2.2 AI Model Integration
- Initialize CodeBERT and fine-tune on C++ code corpus
- Set up Microsoft Phi-3 for NLP tasks
- Implement PyTorch models for both CodeBERT and Phi-3

### 2.3 Query Processing
- Implement natural language query parsing
- Develop algorithms to map queries to relevant code sections
- Create a response generation system using the AI models

### 2.4 Code Analysis
- Use CodeBERT to analyze the parsed C++ code
- Extract key information such as function definitions, class structures, and control flow

### 2.5 Response Generation
- Combine code analysis results with NLP query understanding
- Generate human-readable responses to user queries
- Ensure responses are contextually relevant to the specific C++ code

## 3. User Interaction Flow

1. User inputs C++ source file
2. Application parses the source file using LLVM
3. CodeBERT analyzes the parsed code
4. User asks a question about the code
5. NLP processor interprets the question
6. Application maps the question to relevant code sections
7. AI models generate a response
8. Application presents the response to the user

## 4. Future Enhancements

- Implement multi-file project support
- Add support for other C++ standards (C++20, C++23)
- Improve AI model accuracy through continuous learning
- Develop a web-based interface for easier access
- Implement caching mechanisms for faster repeated queries
